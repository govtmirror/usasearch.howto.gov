## Highlight: Show Your Footer

Do you have information in the footer of your results page that searchers need to see? Searchers can now view or hide the footer while on your search results page.

After clicking on the Show Footer icon located at the bottom right-hand corner of the search results page, searchers will see the footer.

They'll still be able to scroll infinitely through the search results while the footer is visible. To hide the footer, they can click on the icon again.
