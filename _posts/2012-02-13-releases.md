<p><span>As we start 2012, we </span><span>want to highlight two major, new features. </span></p>
<ol><li><span>Discovery Tag</span>—O<span>ur on-demand indexing engine allows you to automatically add content to your search index. You may make use of our on-demand indexing by placing our Discovery Tag (available on the Get Code page in the admin center) on your web pages.<br/> </span></li>
<li><span>Themes for results pages</span>—Our n<span>ew and improved theme-based results pages help you create a customized look and feel "out of the box." You may view the themes by adding a new site in our admin center. We're also in the process of migrating all customers into this new user interface.</span></li>
