<p>We  hope everyone is staying cool in the dog days of our August summer, but  just because it is hot doesn't mean we aren't busy. <br/> <br/>We  would like to point out an enhancement to our Add to Bing feature.  Immediately after you add a page to Bing, we automatically include it in  your Boosted Content. Once the document is added to the Bing index, we  automatically remove the entry from your Boosted Content. We hope you  enjoy this enhancement as it is something that many of you told us was a  high priority fix.<br/> <br/>As a reminder, we divide our work into three categories:<br/> <br/>1) Features—Things that you actually notice<br/>2) Bugs—Fixes to any code issues that may arise<br/>3) Chores—Back-end improvements that aren't noticed<br/> <br/>Without further adieu, below are the August release notes.<br/><br/><strong>Features </strong></p>
