Do you want your search results page to run web services such as 4Q, AddThis, Foresee, Google Analytics, Omniture, Siteimprove, or WebTrends?

Input the JavaScript code you'd like to call from your search results page. Click submit to send us your request. We'll input your code for you and send you an email to confirm that we've done it.

Some tips for commonly used third party web services follow.

## Google Analytics Tip

In your Google Analytics JavaScript, be sure to set your domain if you've requested <a href="/sites/manual/cname.html">domain masking</a> and you want to include your search subdomain (e.g., search.commerce.gov) with your main domain (e.g., commerce.gov).

    _gaq.push(['_setDomainName', 'commerce.gov']);

For more information, read Google's tip, [Tracking Multiple Domains](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gajs/gaTrackingSite).

The code you submit should look something like one of the following two scripts.

### Google Analytics Code (Older Format)

     <script type="text/javascript">
     var _gaq = _gaq || []; 
     _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-########-1']); 
     _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);
     
     (function() { 
     var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true; 
     ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ? 'https://ssl'; : 'http://www') +      '.google-analytics.com/ga.js'; 
     var s = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(ga, s); 
     })();
     
     </script>

### Google Analytics Code (Newer Format)

    (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
    (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),
    m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)
    })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');

## Digital Analytics Program Tip

Does your federal agency participate in the [Digital Analytics Program](http://www.howto.gov/web-content/digital-metrics/digital-analytics-program) (DAP)? 

You don't need to upload the full DAP Google Analytics code. You can simply say something like, "Add DAP code."

## ForeSee Tip

Coordinate with your ForeSee representative and DigitalGov Search to implement your customer satisfaction survey on your results page. The four general steps follow.

1. Email us at <search@support.digitalgov.gov> to <a href="/sites/manual/cname.html">set up a CNAME</a> for search.{yourdomain}.gov.

2. Update the files path in your Foresee code to use an absolute path instead of a relative path. 

    Find => 'files': '/fsrscripts/',
    
    and replace it with => 'files': '//{yourdomain}/fsrscripts/',
  
    in the following five files.

    * foresee-trigger.js  
    * foresee-tracker.js  
    * foresee-alive.js  
    * foresee-qualifier.js  
    * foresee-test.js

3. Ask ForeSee to send us your foresee-trigger.js file.

4. We'll send you an email to confirm that we've set up your CNAME and installed your foresee-trigger.js file.

It should look something like the following.

     <script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.YourAgency.gov/library/foresee/foresee-trigger.js"></script>
