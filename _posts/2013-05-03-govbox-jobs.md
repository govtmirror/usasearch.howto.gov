One of the most common search tasks is to look for current job openings. To help searchers quickly find relevant jobs we've created the Jobs GovBox. 

When you [turn on the Job Openings GovBox](/sites/manual/display-overview.html), searchers looking for jobs on your site will see up to three relevant jobs listings on your results page. 

## Federal Government

* **Federal Cross-Agency Portals.** If your website is a federal cross-agency portal (e.g., USA.gov), the Jobs GovBox will return relevant, location- and keyword-matched job openings *across all federal agencies*. 
* **Federal Department Websites.** If your website is affiliated with a specific federal department (e.g., Department of Commerce), the Jobs GovBox will return relevant, location- and keyword-matched job openings *across all agencies within your department*. 
* **Federal Agency or Office Websites.** If your website is affiliated with a specific federal agency (e.g., NOAA) or office (e.g, National Ocean Service), the Jobs GovBox will return relevant, location-and keyword-matched job openings *at your agency*. 

Searchers will also see a direct link to [USAJobs.gov](https://www.usajobs.gov) for all current job openings (specific to your department or agency, if applicable), as shown in the sample below for a search on [*jobs*](http://usdasearch.usda.gov/search?affiliate=usda&query=jobs") on the USDA.gov.

## State and Local Government 

If your website is a state or local government site that uses both DigitalGov Search and NeoGov (e.g., Michigan.gov), the Jobs GovBox will return relevant, location- and keyword-matched job openings *across your agency*. 

Searchers will also see a direct link to your NeoGov page for all current job openings specific to your agency, as shown in the sample below for a search on *[jobs](http://search.ci.bloomington.mn.us/search?affiliate=cityofbloomingtonmnsearchresults&query=jobs)* on the City of Bloomington, MN. 

![Search results for jobs on ci.bloomington.mn.us](https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/jobs-bloomington.png)

Otherwise, the Jobs GovBox will return relevant, location- and keyword-matched job openings *across all federal, state, and local agencies*.
