title: "Pilot Program: Bring Your Own Index"
tags: how-to
---

In 2013, we asked you for feedback about DigitalGov Search and other programs in GSA's [Office of Citizen Services and Innovative Technologies](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/25729). Many of you responded to our customer experience survey. 

We learned that, in these times of tight budgets, you value our service being free. We also heard you loud and clear that you'd like to choose which search results you use&mdash;from Bing, Google, or some other source.

So, based on your feedback, we now have a pilot program that allows you to bring your own index (BYOI). This helps us make sure we continue to provide you the best, most cost-effective service possible and gives you the choice you want.

You can either:

* Provide a feed (typically from your database or content management system).
* Provide access to a search index you already have from a commercial provider.

## How to Participate

Since this is still a pilot, the setup is manual. Email us at <search@support.digitalgov.gov> to let us know you're interested in participating in the pilot.

## Option 1. Provide an RSS Feed

You'll have to set up two RSS feeds.

1. Seed feed&mdash;a one-time, full RSS feed that provides us all of your content.
2. Change feed&mdash;an incremental feed that tells us about deltas (new, updated, or deleted content) only.

If you want full text search, provide the full text of your page in the feed's description. If you want a more precise, metadata search, provide a short snippet about your page in the feed's description.

As long as you create structured feeds, we'll index your content. It doesn't matter what  underlying technology system you use. Below are a few good references to get you started for two of the more common CMS, but don't let these links confuse you if you already have a feed generation system in place.

**Drupal** has a few ways to export content as a structured feed, including:

* [RSS Feeds for Views](https://drupal.org/node/83597) ![External link](https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/external_link.gif)
* [Feeds (module to export your entire site)](https://drupal.org/project/feeds) ![External link](https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/external_link.gif)
* [Node Export](https://drupal.org/project/node_export) ![External link](https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/external_link.gif)

**WordPress** provides detailed overview of [how to handle its feeds](http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Feeds). ![External link](https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/external_link.gif)

## Option 2. Provide a Search Index

We can leverage almost any search index directly. For each web search, we'll send a searcher's query to your chosen search index, and we'll render the results within our search results page.  

### Google Search Appliance

If you already have (or plan to purchase), a Google Search Appliance, we can accept the [XML output](https://developers.google.com/search-appliance/documentation/614/xml_reference#results_xml) ![External link](https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/external_link.gif) from your appliance. You'll be responsible for managing the number of documents indexed as this affects the cost of the appliance (such as $x for up to x documents).

See GSAAdvantage for options to [purchase a Google Search Appliance](https://www.gsaadvantage.gov/advantage/s/search.do?q=0:2google+search+appliance).

### Google Site Search

If you already have (or plan to purchase), Google Site Search, we can accept your [API key](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/json-api/v1/overview) ![External link](https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/external_link.gif). You'll be responsible for managing traffic levels as this affects the cost (such as $x per 1,000 queries).

See GSAAdvantage for options to [purchase Google Site Search](https://www.gsaadvantage.gov/advantage/s/search.do?q=0:2google+site+search).

### Other Search Indexes

Most search indexes expose their results as XML. If you have another search index that renders XML, let us know and we'll work with you to determine if it will work within our system.
