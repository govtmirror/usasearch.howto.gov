<p>In April, we released several important underlying infrastructure changes. These changes will allow us to deliver more features for our agency customers and searchers in the months ahead. For example, we upgraded all of our customers to a new template-based system, which will provide us with the flexibility to roll out new video, image, and social media features seamlessly.</p>
<p>Below are the release details for April and, as a reminder, we divide our work into three categories.</p>
