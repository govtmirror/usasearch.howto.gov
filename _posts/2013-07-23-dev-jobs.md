## Overview

The unemployment rate has hovered around 8 percent since early 2012. So, not surprisingly, many people are hitting the web to search for jobs.

Federal, state, and local government agencies are hiring and have thousands of job openings across the country.

This Jobs API allows you to tap into a list of current jobs openings with the government. Jobs are searchable by keyword, location, agency, schedule, or any combination of these.

This API is great for job websites or applications, job banks, and career counseling and placement applications.

## Using the API

This Jobs API accepts a GET request.

Jobs are searchable by keyword, location, agency, schedule, or any combination of these.

<a name="parameters"></a> 

## Parameters

Seven parameters are accepted.

1. query
1. organization_id
1. hl (for highlighting)
1. size
1. from
1. tags
1. lat_lon

### Query

Attempts to extract as much "signal" as possible from the input text. Handles word variants, so a search on "nursing jobs" will find a job titled "nurse practitioner" and "RN." When parts of the query parameter are used to search against the position title, the results are ordered by relevance. When no query parameter is specified, they are ordered by date with the most recent listed first.  For generic jobs searches (e.g., 'jobs', 'internships') where the **lat_lon** parameter is passed in, the results will be sorted by distance to the searcher's geographic location.

Sample query formats follow.

#### All jobs (by date or by proximity)

* jobs
* positions
* vacancies
* opportunities
* postings

#### Location-based (by date)

* jobs in fulton
* jobs in fulton, md
* jobs in fulton, maryland
* jobs in md
* pentagon jobs
* jobs fayetteville
* fayetteville nc jobs
* jobs atlanta georgia

#### Agency-based (by date)

* job opportunities at the cia
* jobs at the treasury dept
* tsa job openings
* va jobs # will match jobs in Virginia

#### Keyword-based (by relevance)

* nursing jobs
* summer internship position

#### Schedule-based (by date)

* part-time jobs
* full-time positions

#### Combinations (by relevance)

* part-time security guard job openings at the tsa in los angeles, ca

### Organization_id

Specifies which federal, state, or local agency to use as a filter. 

For federal agencies, the ID is based on [USAJobs' agency schema](https://schemas.usajobs.gov/Enumerations/AgencySubElement.xml). Two letter codes are used to span entire departments, while four letter codes are generally used for independent agencies or agencies within a department.

For state and local agencies, a sample of the format follows.

*State of Virginia*  
US-VA

*State of Virginia Department of Taxation*  
US-VA:DEPT-TAX

*Fairfax County, VA*  
US-VA:COUNTY-FAIRFAX

*Fairfax County Sheriff*  
US-VA:COUNTY-FAIRFAX:SHERIFF

*City of Fairfax, VA*  
US-VA:COUNTY-FAIRFAX:CITY-FAIRFAX

If you specify an `organization_id` in your API call but the searcher types in another agency, the searchers' agency overrides the `organization_id` parameter. For example, VA jobs are returned when you specify Air Force jobs, but the searcher looks for jobs at the VA (<http://api.usa.gov/jobs/search.json?query=jobs+at+the+va&organization_id=AF>).

### Hl [highlighting]

No highlighting is included by default. Use 'hl=1' to highlight terms in the position title that match terms in the user's search. Highlighted terms are surrounded with `<em>` tags. 

### Size

Specifies how many results are returned (up to 100 at a time).

### From

Specifies the starting record.

### Tags

Specifies the level of government. Current tags are `federal`, `state`, `county`, and `city`.

### Lat_lon

Comma-separated pair denoting the position of the searcher looking for a job. For example, 'lat_lon=37.783333,-122.416667' is the value for San Francisco, CA. For generic job searches (e.g., 'jobs', 'internships') where this parameter is passed in, the Jobs API server will sort jobs results and return those that are closest to the searcher's location. For jobs that have multiple locations associated with the position, the distance to the closest location is used to determine the overall geo-distance for the job. Note that for keyword-based job searches (e.g., 'jobs in NY', 'nursing jobs'), this parameter has no effect and is ignored.

## Data Sources

We've tailored this Jobs API for our use in our search results. Data are normalized across government job listings and we don't include all jobs from all data sources. So, we encourage you to use the original data sources directly.

Federal government jobs are from [USAJobs](https://www.usajobs.gov). The USAJobs API for job opportunity announcements is at <https://data.usajobs.gov/Rest>. 

State and local government jobs are from cities, counties, and state agencies that use [NeoGov](http://www.neogov.com) ![External link](https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/external_link.gif), such [jobs with the the city of Boulder, Colorado](https://bouldercolorado.gov/jobs-and-volunteer).

***Are we missing your jobs data?*** E-mail us at <search@support.digitalgov.gov> to let us know where you publish the jobs data for your federal, state, or local government agency. We'll accept your jobs data via FTP or any machine-readable format (such as an RSS feed or API).
