Data underpins everything we do to provide a great search experience on government websites.
In line with the White House's
[Digital Government Strategy](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government.html), we're making our data open through APIs.

Our developer hub connects you&mdash;software developers, researchers, and our
government customers&mdash;with the tools you need to unlock the government data that
underpins our hosted search service.

## For the Public

**[Jobs](jobs.html)**&mdash;This API returns job openings across federal, state, and local government agencies.
