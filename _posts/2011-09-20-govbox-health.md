Searches for health-related information are very common. So we created the Health Topics GovBox to help you provide searchers with high-quality, authoritative health information.

This GovBox offers direct access to [MedlinePlus Health Topics](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/healthtopics.html) and to open studies on [ClinicalTrials.gov](http://clinicaltrials.gov). To ensure we provide timely information across all health topics, we've done this automatically using the [MedlinePlus XML files](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/xml.html), which cover both the English and Spanish health topics.

If you [opt to show the Health Topics GovBox](/sites/manual/display-overview.html), searchers looking for health topics on your site can readily find high-quality health information, as shown in the sample below for a search on *[ovarian cancer](http://search.usa.gov/search?query=ovarian+cancer)* on [NC.gov](http://www.nc.gov).
