The Queries page reports on the number of times a search query (that is, a word or string of words) was entered in the search box on your site by a unique searcher.

Data are shown for the present month-to-date by default. You can change the time period by selecting a different month or year and re-generating the report.

Data start from the time your agency started using our service (but no further back than 2009).

## Top Queries

***Top 1,000.*** You'll see a list, in frequency order, of top 1,000 most popular queries for your selected time period. 

***Top 1,000 by query.*** Enter any specific term or phrase into the Query search box. Re-generate the report to see the top 1,000 queries that contain that term or phrase and its stemmed equivalents. 

For example, below are the top 10 queries related to *housing* on USA.gov in August 2013.

1. house of representatives
