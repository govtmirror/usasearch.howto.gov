Your pre-launch checklist will be unique to your agency's workflow, requirements, and deadlines. A typical punch list to go live with DigitalGov Search follows.

## Connect Your Site to DigitalGov Search

Most agencies add these two [snippets of code](/sites/manual/code.html) to the template(s) in their content management systems (rather than adding them to individual pages).

<i class="icon-check"></i> **1. Does your search box point to DigitalGov Search?** Update your search box form code point to our service so that, when users execute a search, they'll see your DigitalGov Search-hosted results page.

	<form accept-charset="UTF-8" action="http://search.usa.gov/search" id="search_form" method="get"><div style="margin:0;padding:0;display:inline"><input name="utf8" type="hidden" value="&#x2713;" /></div>
		 <input id="affiliate" name="affiliate" type="hidden" value="YourSiteHandle" /> 
	 	<label for="query">Enter Search Term(s):</label> 
	 	<input autocomplete="off" class="usagov-search-autocomplete" id="query" name="query" type="text" /> 
	 	<input name="commit" type="submit" value="Search" /> 
	</form>

<i class="icon-check"></i> **2. Do you have the our Javascript tag on your webpages?** This Javascript powers the suggestions for type-ahead and [related searches](/sites/manual/display-overview.html). It also provides data on your trending URLs on the [Site Overview](/sites/manual/site-overview.html) page in the [Admin Center](https://search.usa.gov/sites/).

	<script type="text/javascript">
	//<![CDATA[
		 var usasearch_config = { siteHandle:"YourSiteHandle" };
	 	var script = document.createElement("script");
	 	script.type = "text/javascript";
	 	script.src = "http://search.usa.gov/javascripts/remote.loader.js";
	 	document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(script);
	//]]>
	</script>

## Double Check Your Content Sources

<i class="icon-check"></i> **3. Have you told us which domain(s) you want to search?** List one or more [domains](/sites/manual/domains.html) that you want to search on the first page of web results. Most agencies opt to leave out the 'www' to include all subdomains (for example, list usa.gov to include answers.usa.gov, blog.usa.gov, publications.usa.gov, etc). Some agencies especially department-level portals opt to also include their bureaus' websites (for example, Commerce.gov includes commerce.gov, noaa.gov, trade.gov, etc.)

<i class="icon-check"></i> **4. Have you told us about your RSS feeds?** We love [RSS feeds](/sites/manual/rss.html). Tell us about all of your feeds, even if you opt not to show them (see #7 below). They're the quickest way for you to tell us about your new and updated content. Feeds also have well-structured titles, URLs, descriptions, and dates that we use to improve your search results page. (Tip: Preview your feeds from the RSS page in the [Admin Center](https://search.usa.gov/sites/) to confirm that we've indexed your content.)

<i class="icon-check"></i> **5. Have you told us about your social media accounts?** [Flickr photostreams](/sites/manual/flickr.html), [tweets](/sites/manual/twitter.html), and [YouTube videos](/sites/manual/youtube.html) are a great way to highlight your recent content. Tell us about all of your social media, even if you opt not to show them (see #7 below). 

## Customize the Display of Your Search Results Page

<i class="icon-check"></i> **6. Have you made the search results page look like your website?** Customize the [fonts and colors](/sites/manual/font-colors.html) and [image assets](/sites/manual/display-images.html) (logo, background image, and favicon) of your search results page to create a seamless experience for users as they search and browse your website.

<i class="icon-check"></i> **7. Have you told us what to show on your results page?** Turn on (or off) the GovBoxes (that is, the inline results in the center of the page) and sidebar options (that is, the facets in the left-hand column) you want to appear on your search results. You can change the default settings on the [Display Overview](/sites/manual/display-overview.html) page in the Admin Center.

## Set Up Nice-to-Have Features (Optional)

<i class="icon-check"></i> **8. Have you masked your domain?** We offer [DNS masking](/sites/manual/cname.html), which allows you to show searchers your search.YOURSITE.gov (instead of search.USA.gov). If you leverage DNS masking you will have to change your search box form action from search.usa.gov to search.YOURSITE.gov. 

<i class="icon-check"></i> **9. Have you added the Javascripts for your other third party web services to your results page?** If you have a [third party service](/sites/manual/third-party.html) running on your website, you likely want it to run on your results page. Agencies often include their 4Q, AddThis, Foresee, Google Analytics, Omniture, or WebTrends code, among others.

## Don't Forget SEO (Optional)

<i class="icon-check"></i> **10. Have you optimized your site so we can find your content?** We follow [search engine optimization](http://www.howto.gov/web-content/search/seo) (SEO) best practices. Verify that you have a [robots.txt](http://www.robotstxt.org) ![External link](https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/external_link.gif) and an [XML sitemap](http://www.sitemaps.org) ![External link](https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/external_link.gif). These two files are typically located in the root directory of your website (i.e., agency.gov/robots.txt and agency.gov/sitemap.xml, respectively). Also verify that your robots.txt file allows our user agent (usasearch) to access your public content.

<i class="icon-check"></i> **11. Have you registered your site with the major commercial search engines?** Register for both [Bing Webmaster Tools](http://www.bing.com/toolbox/webmaster) ![External link](https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/external_link.gif) and [Google Webmaster Tools](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home?hl=en) ![External link](https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/external_link.gif) to maximize the coverage of your content in their search results.
