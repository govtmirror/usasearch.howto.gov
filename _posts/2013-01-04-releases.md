<h2>Highlighted Feature</h2>
<p>Are you curious about the most searched for terms on your site in the past year? They'll arrive in your inbox in our new, <span>annual</span><span> </span><span>Year-in-Review email.</span></p>
<p>We'll send you an email every December 15 (along with cheer and goodwill) with a list of the top 1,000 terms searched for on your site over the past year and how many times each term was searched.</p>
<h2>Other Features</h2>
<ul><li><span>Developers using our <a href="https://github.com/GSA/jobs_api">jobs API</a> can find agency-specific jobs by searching for an agency's name, abbreviation, or other variant.</span></li>
</ul><h2>Chores</h2>
<ul><li>We upgraded to <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2013/1/2/Rails-3-2-10--3-1-9--and-3-0-18-have-been-released/">Rails 3.2.10</a>.</li>
<li>We sped up our interaction with the <a href="http://www.bing.com/developers/">Bing Search API</a>.</li>
<li>We set up an automatic download of current jobs opening from <a href="https://schemas.usajobs.gov/">USAJobs' jobs export</a>.</li>
</ul><h2>Fixes</h2>
<ul><li><span>Searchers and API users are now able to maintain a HTTP connection for multiple requests resulting in shorter response times.</span></li>
</ul>
