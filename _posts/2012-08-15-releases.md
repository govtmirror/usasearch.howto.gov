<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<p><em>Highlight: More Faceted Navigation Options </em></p>
<p><span>Searchers can now narrow their results by up to three additional facets</span>—contributor, publisher, or subject. To start using this feature, simply update any of your <a href="/sites/manual/rss.html">RSS feeds</a> to include these Dublin Core properties. </p>
<p><em>Other features</em></p>
<ul><li><span>Searchers are able to show and hide options (e.g., the time filter) from the sidebar on the results page.</span></li>
</ul><p><strong>Chores</strong></p>
<ul><li>We investigated additional tools to monitor our application and the speed of our results.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Fixes</strong></p>
<ul><li>We fixed the z-index so that type-ahead suggestions always appear on top of other page elements. We also updated the CSS for our type-ahead to ensure it doesn't conflict with your CSS.</li>
<li>We fixed our recalls API to return the expected response and to handle null values for recalled_on.</li>
</ul>
