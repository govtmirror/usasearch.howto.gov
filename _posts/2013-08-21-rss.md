Would you like searchers to be able to search your news or multimedia content? Would you like them to be able to narrow results by date? 

Tell us the locations and names of your RSS feeds. We index all new and updated content on your feeds within minutes.

## Step 1. Tell Us About Your RSS Feeds

We love feeds! Tell us about *all* of your RSS feeds, even if you don't opt to show them in step 2 below. Feeds are the fastest and most reliable way for us to learn about your new and updated content. 

Select the option to add a new RSS feed. 

### Name

Create a name for the feed. Within this 'bucket' you can list a single RSS feed or many feeds. For example, you can opt to list all of your agency's press releases separately (such as Police News, Fire News, EMS News, etc.) or you can list all three under one general name (such as News).

![Add an RSS Feed](https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/rss.png)

### Feed type

Select the type of feed. The default option is RSS (for text content like press releases or blogs). Change it to [media RSS](http://www.rssboard.org/media-rss) ![External link](https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/external_link.gif) for multimedia content like images and videos.

Each item within a RSS feed must include a title, link, description, and publication date. 

Each item within a media RSS feed must also include both a [media:content URL](http://www.rssboard.org/media-rss#media-content) ![External link](https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/external_link.gif) to specify a direct URL to the media object and a [media:thumbnail URL](http://www.rssboard.org/media-rss#media-thumbnails) ![External link](https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/external_link.gif) to specify a URL to the object's thumbnail.

Any items missing a required element won't display in your search results.

## Step 2. Opt to Show as a GovBox, in the Sidebar, or Both

Allow searchers to see inline results for the three most recent, relevant RSS results *across all of your RSS feeds* by turning on the News GovBox on the [Display Overview](/sites/manual/display-overview.html) page. You can also edit the default title, News, on the Display Overview page.

Allow searchers to see narrow results to a specific feed in the left-hand column of the results page by turning on the option to show in the Sidebar on the [Display Overview](/sites/manual/display-overview.html) page. To ensure searchers don't encounter too many dead ends, we recommend showing only feeds with a significant amount of content as a sidebar option.

## Step 3. Check Your Search Results Page

**GovBox.** If you opted to show your RSS feed(s) as a GovBox, searchers will see a News GovBox. This GovBox will highlight the three most recent, relevant results across all of your RSS feeds.

**Sidebar.** If you opted to show your RSS feed(s) in the sidebar, searchers can narrow their results to see your RSS-based results only. 

Within the RSS-based results, searchers can opt to limit results to the last hour, day, week, month, or year, or they can set a custom date range. They also can sort results in descending order by relevance (best match first) or date (most recent first).

***Troubleshooting tip:*** We index the content on your RSS feeds from the time you input them in the [Admin Center](https://search.usa.gov/sites/). To backfill historical content, temporarily modify your RSS feeds to return more results. Leave this larger feed in place for one hour. You can do this during off-hours and you don't need to coordinate with us.

***Did you know?*** You can set up a search box on your website that limits results to your feed.

Start with the standard form snippet on the [Code Snippets](/sites/manual/code.html) page under the Activate Search tab. Change the form action to `action="http://search.usa.gov/search/news` and add the following line to limit the results to your feed.

`<input type="hidden" name="channel" value="###">`

The value is the number for your feed ID, which is visible in the URL when you edit your feed in the Admin Center.

***Did you know?*** You can click on the 'Preview' option to see the content we have indexed for each of your RSS feeds.

***Did you know?*** When you [provide us with your YouTube channel](/sites/manual/youtube.html), we'll automatically index the RSS feed for your YouTube channel.

***Did you know?*** For any feeds that you've extended with a contributor, publisher, or subject [Dublin Core](http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/) ![External link](https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/external_link.gif) property, searchers may narrow results by these facets in the [sidebar](/sites/manual/display-overview.html) on the results page.
