<p class="MsoNormal"><span>It's hard to believe August is already here. Over the past three weeks, we finished a long list of summer chores and we're happy to have a clear deck to offer you more features in the coming months.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span></span>We upgraded our environment to <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2012/1/20/rails-3-2-0-faster-dev-mode-routing-explain-queries-tagged-logger-store/">Rails 3.2</a>. This upgrade ensures continued stability and allows us to maintain our record of exceeding our service level agreements.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We also changed our back-end logic for indexing your content. We now index secure (https) content. We also now allow you to give instructions to our user agent in your <a href="http://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html">robots.txt</a> file.</p>
