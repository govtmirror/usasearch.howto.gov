## Font Family

Select your preferred font family. The default option is 'Arial, sans-serif'.

## Color Scheme

Leave the default color scheme as-is, or select Custom to create a customized scheme.

Customize the color of any page element by clicking on it and entering a valid three- or six-digit hex value. You can also pick a color by dragging your mouse inside the color picker window.

***Content border.*** Select the option, Show Content Border, to add some padding above your search results. If you don't select the option, the results will be flush against the top of the browser window.

***Content box shadow.*** Select the option, Show Content Box Shadow, to display a drop shadow around the main 'box' of content on your results page. If you don't select the option, no drop shadow will appear. Note that the shadow isn't supported by Internet Explorer (IE) 7 or 8.
