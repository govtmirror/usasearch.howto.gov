As you update your site's display settings, you can preview your search results page before pushing the changes to your live website.

Visit our [Admin Center](https://search.usa.gov/sites/), select your site, and click on the Preview option (the eye icon) in the left-hand menu. 

![Select the preview option](https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/preview-nav.png)

A preview of your search results page will appear as an overlay in the current window.

**View Staged.** This option will allow you to view the staged search results page before you publish it to your live site. You'll see this option if you have staged changes.

**View Current.** This option will allow you to view the current, live search results page on your site. This is the only option you'll see if you don't have any staged changes.

You'll also see corresponding options for **View Staged Mobile** and **View Current Mobile** to view your mobile search results page.

Close the preview overlay by selecting the 'x' option in the upper right-hand corner. You'll return to whichever page you had originally been on in the Admin Center.
