The primary mission of the Defense Media Activity (DMA) is to provide a broad range of high quality multimedia products and services to inform, educate, and entertain Department of Defense audiences around the world. DMA Public Web delivers information to a worldwide audience via 500+ official Department of Defense websites such as the official websites for Department of Defense, Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force, Marines, Navy, and Army Corps of Engineers.

Our goal is to do that using the latest technologies available in the most cost effective manner possible. Partnering with DigitalGov Search has enabled us to further enhance our capabilities while saving upwards of $214,000 per year from our previous enterprise search system.

DigitalGov Search has empowered us with more control over search results to more effectively help our customers quickly and easily find the information they are looking for. Their flexible system allows us to make adjustments with ease and quickly deploy search for new sites, two elements that are crucial to the success of our operations.

Beyond that, we feel that DigitalGov Search values their stakeholders and we appreciate their flexibility, attention to detail, and migration assistance. They have been in constant contact with our team, and have adjusted their code numerous times to meet our core mission requirements with nothing less than superlative and reliable results. This program is a terrific example of how government agencies are finding new and creative ways to save money while still providing a much needed service.
