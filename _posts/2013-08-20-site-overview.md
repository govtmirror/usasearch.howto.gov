The Site Overview page provides a snapshot of what has been happening on your site in the past day or so.

You can also opt to receive this snapshot as a daily email by clicking on the envelope icon next to your selected site. 

## Top Queries

Reports on the top 10 searches done by searchers on your site. If you don't have any searches, you'll see a message that there aren't enough query data available. These typically don't require any action as they don't change much from day-to-day.

Note that the data are processed to present "real" searches by humans (that is, the data are de-duped by IP address to remove bot traffic and other noise).

## Top Clicked URLs

Reports on the top 10 pages that were clicked thru by searchers on your search results page. If you don't have any clicks, you'll see a message that there aren't enough click data available. These typically don't require any action as they don't change much from day-to-day.

## Trending URLs

If there are any pages that are trending, they'll appear here. Reports on up to the top 10 changing URLs that were *visited by users on your website*. 

Use this report to identify newly popular pages on your website. Investigate why pages are trending, if the reason is not immediately apparent.

Note that you'll only see this list of trending URLs if you have our [Javascript snippet](/sites/manual/code.html) on your web pages. Data are updated every few minutes so this is near real-time information and you may see URLs come and go quickly.

## Trending Queries

If there are any queries that are trending, they'll appear here. Reports on up to the top 10 changing search terms with the greatest *gain* between yesterday and today.

Use this report to identify newly popular terms. Create new content or update existing content to ensure it's current, accurate, and complete.

## Queries with No Results

If there are any terms that returned no results, they'll appear here. Reports on up to the top 10 queries with no results.

For example, on one agency's website in October 2012, a dozen searches for *frostline* returned no results. The frost line&mdash;also known as depth of frost or freezing&mdash;is the depth to which the groundwater in soil is expected to freeze. The agency's pages on the topic referred to this concept as *depth of freezing*. 

Use this alert about results data to help searchers find your content by adding a [Best Bet](/sites/manual/best-bets-text.html), updating your existing web pages, or both.

## Top Queries with Low Click Thrus

If there are any frequently searched terms that returned results but didn't result in a click at least 20% of the time, they'll appear here. Reports on up to the top 10 searches with low click thru rates. 

Use this alert about low click thrus to identify issues with coverage. You may opt to create a [Best Bet: Text](/sites/manual/best-bets-text.html) or [Best Bet: Graphics](/sites/manual/best-bets-graphics.html), add pages that may be missing from the results, or do both to improve recall. Or, you may opt to incorporate language from these popular search terms into your titles and descriptions to improve the relevance of results.

## This Month's Totals to Date

Reports on the total number of queries and clicks for the present month-to-date. A click  is recorded each time a searcher clicks on a results link. 

A graph of your site's total search queries over time is also presented to provide an overview of how your traffic has trended from the time your agency started using our service (but no further back than 2010). Hover over the trend line to see the total number of queries in previous months.
