<p>We've moved! Our homepage is now usasearch.howto.gov.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.howto.gov">HowTo.gov</a> is a website to help government workers deliver a better customer experience to citizens. HowTo.gov is managed by <a href="http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/25729">GSA's Office of Citizen Services and Innovative Technologies</a> and the <a href="http://www.howto.gov/communities/federal-web-managers-council">Federal Web Managers Council</a>, and is supported by other communities of practice.
