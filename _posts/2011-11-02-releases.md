<p><span></span>October wasn't scary for us. We enhanced your ability to immediately add content to your search results. You can now tell us about a URL or RSS feed in the <a href="http://search.usa.gov/sites">Admin Center</a> and we will immediately index the content and display it on your results page.</p>
<p>Additionally, we now offer real-time reporting for your search queries in the Affiliate Center, allowing you to see your website's search activity throughout the day.</p>
<p><span>As a reminder, we divide our work into three categories:</span><span> </span></p>
<p>1) Features—Things that you actually notice;<br/>2) Chores—Back-end improvements that you don't notice; and<span><br/>3) Bugs—Fixes to any code issues that may arise.</span></p>
