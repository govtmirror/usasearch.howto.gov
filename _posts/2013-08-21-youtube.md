## Tell Us About Your YouTube Channel

Provide us with the username for your YouTube channel(s). When you're on YouTube's website, you can see your username in the URL at http://www.youtube.com/user/YourUserName.

For example, the username for NASA's YouTube channel is [NASAtelevision](http://www.youtube.com/user/NASAtelevision) ![External link](https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/external_link.gif).

## Opt to Display Your Videos

When you add the username for your YouTube channel, we'll automatically index your videos&mdash;both your uploaded videos and playlists. 

You can control the display of the videos on the [Display Overview](/sites/manual/display-overview.html) page. You can show the videos as a (a) facet by turning on the option to show in the Sidebar, (b) GovBox on your main web results page by turning on the option to show as a GovBox, or both.

You can edit the default title, Videos, on the RSS feed on the [RSS](/sites/manual/rss.html) page.
