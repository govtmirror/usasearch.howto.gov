You can directly access your raw HTTP logs. The logs include valuable data on searches, clicks, and discovery tag page loads.

With the raw logs, you can conduct in-depth, ad hoc analyses to answer any questions that you can't answer using the standard analytics reports in the [Admin Center](https://search.usa.gov/sites/). You can also automatically integrate your search logs with your other reports and business processes.

To access your raw logs, you'll first need to upload your public key on the Raw Logs Access page in the [Admin Center](https://search.usa.gov/sites/).

We'll set up your public key on our secure FTP servers and send you an email when your logs are available for download.

Once your key is set up, you'll be able access your log files via secure FTP. We upload your logs each day, usually within several hours after midnight GMT. After a week, we purge the older files.

We recommend that you set up a cron script to automatically download the latest files each day.

## How to Generate a Key Pair on Unix

On Unix systems, you can generate a RSA public key with no passphrase by typing in the following command. Generate the key from the machine or server that you'll be using to download the logs. Once you've created a key, it'll be located at /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.

	% cd ~
	% ssh-keygen -q -b 4096 -t rsa
	Enter file in which to save the key (/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa):
	Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
	Enter same passphrase again:

## How to Generate a Key Pair on Windows

You can use [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/), a free telnet/SSH client, to generate a public key on Windows. Download PuTTYgen.exe, Pageant.exe, and PSFTP.exe from the [PuTTY Download Page](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html).

Run PuTTYgen.exe. 

* Select SSH-2 RSA as the type of key to generate. 
* Set the number of bits in the generated key to 2048.
* Select Generate. Move your mouse within the blank area to create random movements until the key is generated. 
* Fill out your Key Comment, Key Passphrase, and Confirm Passphrase.
* Copy your *public* key from the string in the Public Key for Pasting into OpenSSH Authorized_keys File. Paste this key into the Raw Logs Access page in the [Admin Center](https://search.usa.gov/sites/). (Note: Don't save this public key and send us the string copied from a text file. It adds lines in the file so it doesn't work.)
* Save your *private* key. 

Run Pageant.exe. Select Add Key and upload your private key, the .ppk file.

Run PSFTP.exe and type in the following. You can find your site's handle on the Site Information page in the [Admin Center](https://search.usa.gov/sites/).
