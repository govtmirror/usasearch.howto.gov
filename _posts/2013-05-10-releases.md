## Highlight: Search Your Twitter Lists

Does your agency have dozens of Twitter accounts? Do you have a public Twitter list for these accounts? You can now opt to [index tweets](/sites/manual/twitter.html) from your lists. You can either:

* Show tweets from your Twitter account only (for example, index and show tweets from [@USDA](https://twitter.com/USDA) ![External link](https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/external_link.gif) only)
* Show tweets from your account's public lists (for example, index and show tweets from the all members of @USDA's list, [USDA Twitter accounts](https://twitter.com/USDA/lists/usda-twitter-accounts) ![External link](https://9fddeb862c037f6d2190-f1564c64756a8cfee25b6b19953b1d23.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/external_link.gif)).

(Thanks, [NIH.gov](http://www.nih.gov) team, for suggesting this new feature!)

## Other Features

* Searchers on Spanish-language websites now see the [Jobs GovBox](/sites/manual/govbox-jobs.html) when they search on jobs-related terms. For example, a Jobs GovBox appears on GobiernoUSA.gov for a search on [*trabajos*](http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=gobiernousa&query=trabajos).

## Chores

* We updated the cron script for our monthly analytics emails.
* We updated our stemming file.

## Fixes

* We now correctly identify the Food and Drug Administration or Food Safety and Inspection Service as the data sources in our [Recalls API](/developer/recalls.html).
* We fixed how we handle registered trademarks in the [Recalls API](/developer/recalls.html) so that searchers can now find items such as Zicam&reg;.
* We now provide a better response when an API call specifies the 'doc' index but doesn't include the required, complementary 'dc' parameter.
