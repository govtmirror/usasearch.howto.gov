Do you want to promote a specific web page or collection of web pages? Create a Graphics Best Bet.

A best bet appears above the standard web results when a searcher's query matches the text of its title, description, or keywords.

Graphics best bets have a one or two-column layout and you can add an image. The most relevant best bet is listed under a heading, {Best Bet Title} by {[Site Name](/sites/manual/settings.html)}.

See, for example, the variety of layouts possible for graphics best bets.

* **One column with a collection of links and an image** displayed on USA.gov for a search on *[wildfires](http://search.usa.gov/search?query=wildfires&affiliate=usa.gov)*. 

* **One column with a link to a specific web page and an image** displayed on WhiteHouse.gov for a search on *[jobs](http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=wh&query=jobs)*.

* **Two columns with a collection of links only** displayed on USA.gov for a search on *[holidays](http://search.usa.gov/search?query=holidays&affiliate=usa.gov)*. 

## Add a Graphics Best Bet

***Title.*** Add the title (up to 255 characters) of the web page or collection of web pages that you want to promote. The title is visible to searchers.

***Title URL.*** Add the URL of the primary web page that you want to promote. This field is optional.

***Status and Publish Dates.*** The default start date is the day on which you create the best bet. The default end date is null, so it will stay up forever until you decide to take it down. You can opt to set a start and end date to control to specify other start and end dates. You can also opt to set its status as either active or inactive.

***Layout.*** Select a one- or two-column layout. 

***Image.*** You can opt to add an image. Be sure to choose only images for which the display rights are not limited. Include alt text and attribution, as needed. The attribution URL links the attribution text to a webpage of your choice. Sometimes linking to the actual site where the image was found is not appropriate, so you may opt not to use this field.

***Keywords.*** Keywords are optional and they're *not* visible to searchers. Add specific words or phrases that aren't already included in the visible title or link titles. Common keywords include synonyms, acronyms, compound words, misspellings, slang, or other variants. Enter each keyword (word or phrase up to 255 characters) in a separate field.

***Links.*** Enter a title and URL for each link. There is no limit on the number of links. Use the three horizontal bars on the left to rearrange the display order of the links. If you select a two-column layout above, links are displayed in newspaper-style format, with an automatic break for columns depending on how many links you list. The link titles are visible to searchers.

## When Searchers See Your Best Bets

Searchers see your best bets when their query:

* Matches any or all words in the title,
* Matches any of all words in the link titles, or
* Matches a keyword exactly.

Matches are made within, but not across, fields.

A sample best bet entry is below.

**Title:** Estate Tax  
**Link title 1:** Transfer Property After You Pass Away  
**Link title 2:** Estate Tax Rights  
**Link title 3:** Tax Rates  
**Keyword 1:** death tax  
**Keyword 2:** inheritance tax  
**Keyword 3:** fair market value  
**Keyword 4:** market value  

This best bet would display for searches on estate tax (exact title match), estate (partial title match), tax on the estate (title match that includes stopwords), estate taxes (title match for singular/plural variant), property tax (partial link title match), propertey tax (link title match with a slight misspelling), and death tax (exact keyword match), among other queries.

It would *not* display for searches on death, death property, taxes after death, fair value, or estate property tax as they're only partial keyword or cross field matches.
